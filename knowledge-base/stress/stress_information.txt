Stress Information:

Stress is the body's natural response to pressure, challenges, or demands. 
While short-term stress can boost performance, chronic stress may harm mental and physical health.

Common signs:
- Irritability or mood swings
- Difficulty sleeping
- Headaches or muscle tension
- Trouble concentrating
- Feeling overwhelmed

Effective coping includes relaxation techniques, time management, exercise, and seeking support when needed.
