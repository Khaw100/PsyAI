Examples of general mental health concerns:

- "I just feel off but I can't explain why."
- "Sometimes I feel empty and it's not clear if it's stress or depression."
- "I don’t know what I’m feeling, but I need someone to talk to."
- "My mind feels scattered, I can’t pinpoint the problem."
- "I just want to know how to take care of my mental health better."
