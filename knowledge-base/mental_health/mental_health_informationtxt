General Mental Health Information:

Mental health refers to our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. 
It affects how we think, feel, and behave in daily life. Good mental health helps 
us cope with stress, relate to others, and make healthy decisions.

Key aspects of maintaining mental health:
- Practicing self-care (exercise, sleep, nutrition, relaxation)
- Building supportive social relationships
- Seeking help when feeling overwhelmed
- Managing stress with healthy coping strategies
- Talking openly about feelings

Remember: It is normal to experience ups and downs. 
If struggles continue or intensify, reaching out to a psychologist or counselor 
can provide support and guidance.
